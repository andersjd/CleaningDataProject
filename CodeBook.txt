Document Purpose
================
This document details the Source Data used in the project, the transformations
and manipulations made to that data, and the detailed structure of the
resulting data file.

For more general information on the general goals assumptions, and approach,
please see the ReadMe.md file associated with this project.


Project Data Source
===================
This project uses and is dependent upon the"Human Activity Recognition Using 
Smartphones Dataset", which can be obtained at the following URL:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

Please see the README.txt and features_info.txt from that location for
information on the original experiments that generated the source data.
More general information can be found at:

Data Source Files
=================
The following data files were used from the original data set:

   features.txt: List of all features (accelerometer and gyroscope readings)
      Used as a basis to derive column names in the final set

   test/x_test.txt and train/x_train.txt: Test and Training Sets
      Base data records (measurements) that are combined into the final set

   test/y_test.txt and train/y_train.txt: Test and Training Label IDs
      Used to align Activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS,
      SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) with the base data records

   test/subject_test.txt and train/subject_train.txt: Subject Identification
      Used to align Subjects (ID'd 1 through 30) with the Base data records

   activity_labels.txt: Text Activity names
      Used to replace the numeric activity IDs from y_test/y_train into readable
      text values


Data Transformations
====================
The following data Manipulations are used to create the results data set.

1. The features.txt table is used to replace the column names in the x_test and
   x_train tables to provide meaningful column names for the measurements

2. The y_test and y_train tables are joined to the x_test and x_train
   tables in order to align the Activity IDs with the measurements

3. The subject_test and subject_train tables are joined to the x_test
   and x_train tables in order to align the Subject IDs with the measurements

4. The x_test and x_train tables are combined into a single table
   (Note that the Subjects are different between the x_test and x_train tables
    so no overlap of data occurred)

5. The activity_labels are joined with the combined table in order to provide
   readable text names for the activities

6. Columns that do not contain "mean()" or "std()" are removed from the combined
   table**

7. The combined table is grouped by Activity and Subject with the remaining columns
   averaged to create a summary table**

8. The Column (measurement) names in the summary table are updated with the following
   logic to be (somewhat) more readable**
	a. Replace the preceeding characters "t" and "f" with "Time" and "Frequency"
	b. Replace "-mean()" with "AverageMean" to reflect the new summarized amount
	c. Replace "-std()" with "AverageStdDev" to reflect the new summarized amount
        d. Remove the special character minus signs from "-X","-Y", and "-Z" 

** See the ReadMe.md file for specific requirements driving items 6, 7, and 8.


Project Data Set Results structure
==================================
The resulting data files is generated using "write.table" with row names excluded and
the first record containing Column Names. The following code will load it into R:

  read.table("FileName",header=TRUE)

The result table is 180 rows by 68 Columns, with each row defining a unique combination
of Activity and SubjectID, and the remaining columns containing the averaged
Mean and Standard Deviation (StdDev) measurements along the three Axis (X, Y, Z)***

*** See the documentation associated with the source data set for more information on
    the meaning of these measurements

All Fields are required and no NA values exist in the data
